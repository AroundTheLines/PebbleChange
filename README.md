# PebbleChange
An application for Pebble created in 36 hours at the University of Toronto's UofHacks hackathon.

With this app, users can donate to various organizations and charities using their Pebble.
They choose how much money they want to donate (currently at intervals of $1,$3 and $5)
They also choose the donation range (Local organizations, National Organizations and Internation Organizations).
After the user has made their selections the app displays a potential organization they can donate to (via text).
The app will also display a QR code (after user presses select) they can scan to visit the organizations website and find out more.
There is also a trending charities option in the main menu that displays currently trending organizations or charites (such as ALS and the ALS Ice Bucket Challenge).
